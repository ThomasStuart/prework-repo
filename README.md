This app. is a tip calculator that performs the basic enter bill amount,
 select tip, and display the total with a few additionally features.
 The biggest feature is the slider bar that allows the user to split 
the tip between people. Icons of people show up and represent the 
number the slider is at. Additionally, I added an app Icon and a 
custom tip box that adjusts when the user puts in a number greater than 100%
